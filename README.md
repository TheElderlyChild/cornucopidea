Sharing, finding and working on ideas.

Finding fresh ideas for projects to work online on or even inspiration has become increasingly difficult.
Most websites have everything ranked or rated, however this just ensures that some ideas never get seen.
On the other hand, sharing our ideas(and pipe dreams) has become increasingly difficult. 
You have to gather a reasonable following to even have an receptive audience.

That's the purpose of cornucopidea. 
A platform where people share their lazy ideas, idle thoughts and pointless proposals without worrying about completing it.
In turn, people with the time and resources can get inspired by, or turn those ideas into projects, and ultimately, finished products.
